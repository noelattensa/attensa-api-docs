# Introduction

Welcome to the Attensa API! To get started, please <a href='http://attensa.com/contact-us/'>contact us</a> about getting a developer account.

* **Briefings** - Get list of active briefings
* **Categories** - Get and set information about stream categories, including streams and briefings that a category contains.
* **Groups** - Get and set up user groups, including the streams and briefings a group subscribes to.
* **Streams** - Create streams, get information about them post new items into streams
* **Users** - Set up new users, get information about users and subscribe users to streams.
